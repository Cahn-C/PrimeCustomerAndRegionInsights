# ExcelProjects
This repository consists of different analyst projects that involves Data Analytics, Data Analysis and Business Intelligence that will mainly focus on Microsoft Excel.

In this project I created a data model to view the relatoinships for the tables within the diagram, along with creating 2 seperate Pivot Tables to gain insights from the different tables.

Prime Customers: In this project, I wanted to see which region had the most calls and orders based on the customers having a prime membership or not. The insights that I have gained were majority of the calls and orders were from the South Atlantic Region who were prime members and also did not have a prime membership.
