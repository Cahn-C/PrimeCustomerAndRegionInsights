This repository consists of different analyst projects that involves Data Analytics, Data Analysis and Business Intelligence that will mainly focus on Microsoft Excel.

In this project I created a data model to view the relatoinships for the tables within the diagram, along with creating 2 seperate Pivot Tables to gain insights from the different tables. With this data model I was able to obtain the insights that I was looking for.

By joining the tables or connecting relationships with the appropriate columns for each table, I was able to view data in a way that was easy for me to understand and answer my questions.
