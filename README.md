# Customers in different Regions
This repository consists of different analyst projects that involves Data Analytics, Data Analysis and Business Intelligence that will mainly focus on Microsoft Excel.

In this project I created a data model to view the relatoinships for the tables within the diagram, along with creating 2 seperate Pivot Tables to gain insights from the different tables. With this data model I was able to obtain the insights that I was looking for.

By joining the tables or connecting relationships with the appropriate columns for each table, I was able to view data in a way that was easy for me to understand and answer my questions. 

Questions for the Prime Customers:
Q1: Which region has the most calls in total? **South Atlantic**<br><br>
Q2: Which region has the most calls from customers that have the Prime Membership? **South Atlantic**<br><br>
Q3: Which region has the least amount of calls from customers that do not have the Prime Membership? **East North Central**<br><br> 
Q4: Can the highest number of calls have the lowest number of ordes? **In this cse no, if the nuber of calls for one region is high, then the number of orders will be high as well.**
